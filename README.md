# HWR OOP Lecture Project Template

[TODO]: # (Change README.md Headline to better fit to your project!)

This repository contains a student project created for an ongoing lecture on object-oriented programming with Java at HWR Berlin (summer term 2022).

## Abstract
#### 🌸🌸🌸 Welcome to toodleedoo <3 🌸🌸🌸<br>
<p class="blocksatz"> Our application "toodleedoo" is a console-based program that manages all your entered to-do’s for you. Your so-called “tasks” are sorted according to your wishes, automatically by date, and also deadline. With toodleedoo, you always have a clear to-do list at hand. In addition, this to-do application offers the function of a Kanban board, where you can see in three columns which tasks need to be completed, which ones you are currently working on and which of your "tasks" have already been finished. If the list is too full of things that you don't want to do anymore or that have been done, you can simply change or delete them, so that you always have the latest status.
<br> <br> This application was programmed in Java by Emma-Sophie Betz and Begüm Nur Ak 👭🏽.</br> </p>

## Feature List

[TODO]: # (For each feature implemented, add a row to the table!)

| Number | Feature                |Usage                                        | Tests        |

| 2      | save to kanban board   |after you typed in a new task with the required dates, you can also save the taskto the Kanban board <br> <ul> <li> 📝 for that you have to type in “yes” and give your task a label, so that the program knows in which column the task must be placed </ul> </br> 
| 3      |delete task             |to delete a task, that has already been entered in the past<br> <ul> <li>📝 if you have a task listed multiple times, you can easily choose which one to delete by typing in the number on the left side of the tasks </ul> </br>|
| 4      |edit task               | to update a chosen task for you and delete the old task    | 
| 5      |show tasks              |to show you the tasks you need to do,<br> you can also sort them by “today” to see what you need to do the current day, “this week” to see what you need to do the current week and “all tasks” to see all of your tasks</br>|
| 6      |show tasks with filter  |to show you your tasks ordered by deadline or ordered by the date you actually wanted to finish it|

| 8      | what can I do?         | you can type in the exact same sentence and get shown all features you can use|
| 9      | quit                   | to end the program                                         |
